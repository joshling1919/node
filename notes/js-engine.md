## Conceptual Aside
* Processors
    * Microprocessor is a tiny machine.
    * Not all microprocessors are the same (not all speak the same instructions)
* Machine Code
    * Programming languages spoken by computer processors
      * IA-32
      * x86-64
      * ARM
      * MIPS
    * Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.
    * Level of Abstraction
      * Machine Language
      * Assembly Language
      * C/C++
      * Javascript (very far removed from processor)
* C++
    * Node is written in C++
    * V8 is written in C++
      * V8 is the engine that converts Javascript into machine language
